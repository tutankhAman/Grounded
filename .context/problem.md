Engineering Intern Hiring Assignment

This assignment is intentionally open-ended. We want to see how you
explore an unfamiliar problem and turn your ideas into something that
works.

Use any language, framework, database, LLM, coding agent, or
library.

We care more about your approach and creativity than
production-level polish.

Be honest about what works, what does not, and what you would
improve.

The Challenge: Build a Fact Knowledge Layer

Important facts are often scattered across documents, stated in
different ways, supported by other evidence, or contradicted elsewhere.

You will receive three PDFs as a starter dataset. Build a system that:

extracts meaningful numerical or semantic facts;

links every fact to evidence in its source document; and

identifies when facts corroborate, contradict, or can be reconciled
through context.

Provide a simple API or UI through which we can upload PDFs and inspect
the results. We may test your solution with additional PDFs, so it
should not rely on hard-coded facts, filenames, schemas, or
document-specific rules.

The documents should guide what counts as a fact and how it is
represented. Your schema, storage, interface, and output format are
entirely up to you.

A graph database or visualization alone is not the solution. The
interesting part is how facts are discovered, grounded, compared, and
explained.

Show Us These Four Cases

Your submission should include at least one example of each:

A fact corroborated across documents, even if expressed differently.

A genuine or likely contradiction.

An apparent contradiction explained by context, such as time, scope,
or units.

An extraction or reasoning failure you found and how you
handled---or would improve---it.

Show the source evidence and your system's reasoning for the first
three.

For inspiration, two revenue figures may differ because they cover
different periods; a director may appear active in one document and
resigned in a later one; or differently written addresses may refer to
the same place. These are examples, not a required data model or
checklist of facts.

What We Are Looking For

A thoughtful and creative approach.

Useful facts that are grounded in the PDFs.

Sensible handling of ambiguity, context, and uncertainty.

A solution that can generalize beyond the starter documents.

Clear engineering decisions and trade-offs.

We do not expect perfect extraction or a production-ready system. A
smaller, understandable prototype is better than a large system whose
behavior is unclear.

Brownie Points

If the core experience works, try extending it to handle:

large PDFs without significant performance issues;

many PDFs in the same knowledge layer;

a schema that evolves dynamically as new kinds of facts appear; or

new documents incrementally, without rebuilding all existing
knowledge.

These are suggestions, not additional requirements. Feel free to explore
another extension that meaningfully improves the core system.

Submission

Use git meaningfully and create a GitHub repository for your solution.
Include the following sections in your README.md:

Setup and Run Instructions

Tell us how to run your project.

Video Demo

Link to a demo video of 3 minutes or less showing a PDF being processed
and the four required cases above.

Approach

Explain your approach, architecture, important decisions, trade-offs,
and the AI tools you used.

Limitations and Next Steps

Tell us what does not work yet and what you would build next.

Additional Notes

Add anything else you would like us to know.

Keep credentials out of the repository. If the project requires a paid
service, include enough sample output and video footage for us to
evaluate it without needing your account.

Submit your GitHub repository link and demo video link through the form:

https://forms.gle/3fLdBQ2D6Zm2Gqtv7

Before You Submit

The project runs from my instructions and accepts new PDFs
through an API or UI.

Results contain facts, source evidence, and cross-document
relationships.

I demonstrate the four required cases.

I have documented my approach and included a demo video of 3
minutes or less.

Most importantly, have fun tinkering. We are excited to see how you
think.
